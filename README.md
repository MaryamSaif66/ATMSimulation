# ATMSimulationProject 

# Objective

The ATM Simulation System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate the basic functionalities of a real-world ATM. The main objective of this project is to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling by creating a system where users can:

    Log in using a PIN

    Check account balance

    Deposit and withdraw money

    View mini-statement (recent transactions)

    Exit the session

It was developed as an academic/personal project to enhance understanding of Java fundamentals and simulate real-world banking scenarios.
